TITLE Integer & Floating-Point Arithmetic     (HW3.asm)

; Author: Nicolas Barraclough			Date: 2/26/2020
; Course / Project ID: CS271
; Description:
;Write a MASM program to perform the following tasks:
;	1. Display the program title and your name.
;	2. Then get the user's name and greet the user.
;	3. Prompt the user to choose between integer or floating-point arithmetic.
;	4. Using a counted loop, prompt the user to give 5 integer or floating-point numbers based on the
;		choice they did. Push the numbers into the integer or floating-point stack based on the choice
;		they did.
;	5. Calculate and display the sum and the average of the numbers entered.
;	6. Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation or exit.
;	7. When the user chooses to exit the program, display a goodbye message that includes the userï¿½s
;		name and terminate the program.
